Things to update
1. (done) update {CLASS_GRADE_REPORT}
   - comment the extra stuff
   - rename *.log

1. document and unify the naming of
  release_date&
  due_date
  time_limit
  grace_period

8. Test 
  Maybe the grade process is to
     - checkout the version
     - branch the version
     - commit the files
     - then merge the files

1. Create create_assignment


=====

1. maybe add the notition that the assignment was
   for code, paper or both

1. Class information should be available before
    -- this is to allow the running of final grading stuff
   grade-start
      grading.log gets created or update upon grade-start

1. Source bin/grade.bash from .profile
1. Updated grade_start:
   check for validity of location
     1. 

grade_start



1. move away from a .env file -- see makefile above



5 Drive from makefile


7. spilt ??
     - grade_submissions: grading  -- served well if adding/commit was separt in case of multiple grading or fixing stuff
     - update_repo? : adding grade.report, answers.md, etc.
     - publish_grade: publishing:  i.e, publishing is just pushing?




Log file
  - have two types of loging
  1. summary doing a collective operatin
       log_group "-----"
       log_group "doing whateve"
  1. individual item for a individual student
     log_item \t, "student", "date", "message"
     
Check on the case of
    a Makefiel present but for paper work 

If comments are made for the grade report
   as opposed to putting them on the end of the line, make a new line.
   
Need a way to allow prof override on individual student... 
   Due date and time limit
Need a way to grade a section at a time for due date, etc.

Final Grading process.

1. Download updated rosters
   - validate rosters is in case-insensitive ordered to match github account names 
   - place the roster in the top level directory
2. Copy all grades.*.txt files to here
3. Run grades_log2csv on all grades.*.txt --> producing .csv
4. update the spreadsheet to include the .csv files

Fall 2022: 
- All grading and regrades have been validated
  - Directories with grades.* and grades.*.txt 
    - regrades are in grades.*.txt
    - original grades are in grades.*
  - the copies of grades.*.txt after regrading was not done
    - hence the grades.*.csv files are not all up to date
  - regrades have either been 
    - updated to grades.*.csv and included in the spreadsheet
    - directly added to the spreadsheet.

dwarf:assignment-grading steve$ source bin/grade.bash 
-bash: /Users/steve/Desktop/classes/assignment-grading/.grading.env: No such file or directory

dwarf:40-exam-mips steve$ source ../bin/grade.bash 
-bash: /Users/steve/Desktop/classes/assignment-grading/.grading.env: No such file or directory
dwarf:40-exam-mips steve$
